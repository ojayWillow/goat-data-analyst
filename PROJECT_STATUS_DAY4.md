# Day 4 Completion - Streamlit Dashboard

## What Works

? **End-to-end pipeline via Streamlit**
- CSV upload widget
- Live profiling (550K+ rows handled cleanly)
- Quality scoring
- Domain intelligence detection
- Analytics generation
- HTML report generation & download

? **Backend Verified**
- No encoding issues
- No warning spam
- Datetime detection working (pragmatic approach)
- Report layout compact and functional

? **Engineering Debt Logged**
- Documented all pragmatic shortcuts in engineering_debt_log/
- Clear notes on future improvements

## Current Status

**Production-Ready For:**
- CSV profiling and quality scoring
- Batch report generation
- Multi-format export (via backend)

**Not Yet:**
- Hardened datetime detection (acceptable pragmatic version in place)
- UI/UX refinement beyond functional basics
- Deployment & scaling

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Add more Streamlit visualizations (optional)
2. Deploy to cloud (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
3. Harden datetime detection logic (as logged)
4. Merge report generator files (as logged)
5. Add REST API layer

## Time Invested

- Day 1-3: Backend (CSV handler, profiler, quality reports, domain detection, analytics)
- Day 4: Frontend (Streamlit dashboard)
- Total: Clean, tested, documented product with known shortcuts
