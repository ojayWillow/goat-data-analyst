   - 5 tests, all passing (100%)
   - Status: ✅ COMPLETE

3. **Real Data Testing**
   - 5 CSV files, 842K total rows
   - 100% success rate
   - Status: ✅ VALIDATED

4. **Project Infrastructure**
   - GitHub repo with proper structure
   - Virtual environment + dependencies
   - Git version control
   - Status: ✅ SOLID FOUNDATION

## 🎯 WHAT'S NEXT (Day 2)

### Goal: Enhanced CSV Handler + Data Validator

**Morning Session (3-4 hours):**
1. Add streaming support for 1GB+ files
2. Add progress indicators
3. Handle more edge cases (empty files, single row, etc.)
4. Add 10 more unit tests

**Afternoon Session (3-4 hours):**
1. Build data_validator.py (type detection, quality checks)
2. Add 5 more tests for validator
3. Test validator on all 5 real datasets

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Can handle files of ANY size
- ✅ Data quality checks automated
- ✅ 20+ tests passing
- ✅ Ready for domain detection (Day 3)
